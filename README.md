# Comparison between Python and Ruby

## Key difference
Ruby has some sort of fixaction on making code "clean", while throwing away things previously established by other languages
meanwhile python tries to stick to these concepts.

## Conclusion
I would never use either of these languages for real-world applications due to their loosely typed nature.
That said, python is considerably more reasonable when compared to the toy "language" we know as Ruby.
